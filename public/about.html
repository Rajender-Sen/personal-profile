            <p>About:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I specialize in the MERN stack, leveraging MongoDB for efficient data storage, Express.js and Node.js for robust server-side logic and APIs, and React for creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My expertise lies in the MERN stack, allowing me to manage the full software development lifecycle. I build high-performance APIs with Node.js/Express and craft engaging user experiences with React, all while ensuring data integrity with MongoDB.
